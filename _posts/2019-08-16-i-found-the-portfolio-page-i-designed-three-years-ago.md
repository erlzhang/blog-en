It could be a surprise to find the portfolio website I did three years ago when I cleared up the repositories in my Github. I haven't been a full-time developer at that time. I designed and developed just for fun. I even did not know how to use Git and all of the files were uploaded by Github web page.

It is an interesting thing to take a look at the back. I read the rough and messy code I wrote in the time when I thought my JavaScript skill level was pretty fine. I enjoyed the pictures I drew with AI which are not so beautiful and delicate. But I like them. Even the works are childish, just like the naive I.
