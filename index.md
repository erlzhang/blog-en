Hello, I'm Sharon Zhang~

I'm a full-stack web developer lived in Jilin, China, working with `Juby` and `JavaScript`.

 Iâ€™m passionate about programming, design, user experience. I like building minimal websites using static site generators.

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The theme I currently use is [Persephone](https://github.com/erlzhang/jekyll-theme-persephone)

I'm sorry for my poor English speaking and writing, but I'm working hard to improve that. *Thanks to [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com).*

I'm happy to make friends with you.

I like writing. If you happened to be familiar with Chinese, you can find more articles and novels [here](https://erl.im).
