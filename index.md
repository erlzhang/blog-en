ðŸ˜ƒ Hello, I'm Sharon Zhang~

I'm a full-stack web developer lived in Jilin, China, working with `Juby` and `JavaScript`.

Iâ€™m passionate about programming, design and user experience. I like building minimal websites using static site generators. I have made several minimal WordPress themes, Jekyll themes and Jekyll plugins. You can find them from my [Github](https://erlzhang.github.com/erlzhang).

I'm sorry for my poor English speaking and writing, but I'm working hard to improve that. I'd be happy to make friends with you if you don't mind that.

I like writing. If you happen to be familiar with Chinese, you can find more articles and novels from [my Chinese blog](https://erl.im).
