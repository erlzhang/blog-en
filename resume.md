A full stack web developer lived in Jilin, China.

## Skills

My favorite language is JavaScript, for that it can be used both front-end and back-end ( by Node.js ).

In front-end, I’m skillful with **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and raw **JavaScript**. I tried **Vue.js** and **Angular** a little (just for fun). I like front-end development because there is change almost every day.

In back-end, my working language is **Ruby** and **Python**. Besides, I’m familiar with **PHP** for the three years of experience of developing **WordPress themes**.

## Education

### Renmin University of China

<p style="color: var(--gray); margin-top: -20px;">Sep 2010 - Jun 2014</p>

I majored in International Relationships. I love my major. I like reading and thinking about that stuff. But I can’t learn it well. I like building websites during my College time. So I turned to web development.

My blog was built initially in 2012 with WordPress when I was still at school. I started to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript then. But it was hard to get a full-time web development job with the little experience after graduation. So I used to work as a SEO and kept learning skills after work.
